# QSNC-simulation-cost

This project contains MATLAB scripts that supplement the results of the article [1].



## Description :

Supplementary software for implementing the one-shot QSNC assisted zero-error simulation cost is not multiplicative.




## Dependencies:

In order to run these scripts in MATLAB, you must also have CVX [3] and QETLAB [4] downloaded and added to your path.
